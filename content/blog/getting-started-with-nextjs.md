# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 brings exciting new features and improvements that make building modern web applications even more enjoyable. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the key features and learn how to leverage them in your projects.

## What's New in Next.js 15

### Enhanced App Router

The App Router continues to evolve with better performance and developer experience:

```typescript
// app/layout.tsx
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Server Components by Default

Server Components are now the default, providing better performance and SEO:

```tsx
// This runs on the server by default
async function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug);
  
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```

## Key Features to Explore

### 1. Improved Performance

Next.js 15 includes several performance optimizations:

- **Faster builds** with improved bundling
- **Better caching** strategies
- **Optimized images** with automatic WebP conversion

### 2. Enhanced Developer Experience

The development experience has been significantly improved:

- Better error messages
- Improved hot reloading
- Enhanced TypeScript support

### 3. Advanced Routing

The App Router provides powerful routing capabilities:

```typescript
// Dynamic routes with type safety
export default function ProductPage({
  params,
}: {
  params: { category: string; id: string };
}) {
  return <div>Product {params.id} in {params.category}</div>;
}
```

## Best Practices

When working with Next.js 15, keep these best practices in mind:

1. **Use Server Components** for data fetching
2. **Implement proper caching** strategies
3. **Optimize images** with the Image component
4. **Follow accessibility** guidelines

## Conclusion
