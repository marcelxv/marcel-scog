# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current hero section of the portfolio website has layout issues where the professional summary text is taking up excessive space, creating an unbalanced and cramped appearance. The hero section needs a UI refactor to better utilize the available space, improve readability, and create a more visually appealing first impression. The content should remain synchronized with the resume.md file while presenting it in a more digestible and professional format.
