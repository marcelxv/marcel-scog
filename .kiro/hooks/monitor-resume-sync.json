Show me a detailed report of:\n   - Current values in components vs resume data\n   - What would change if sync runs\n   - Any discrepancies that need attention\n3. If changes are needed, ask if I want to run the sync\n4. Provide recommendations for keeping things in sync\n\nThis helps me monitor the automation system and ensure everything stays synchronized.",
