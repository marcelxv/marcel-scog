## Professional Summary

Senior Software Engineer and System Architect with over 8 years of experience in building and scaling platforms. Proven track record in developing high-impact digital products using Next.js and PostgreSQL, with deep experience in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) as well. I'm an expert in designing end-to-end systems, from backend orchestration to a polished user experience, and a specialist in implementing AI-powered automation to improve efficiency and reduce operational costs. My background includes contributing to an edtech platform that served hundreds of thousands of users and building a B2B marketplace from the ground up. I naturally take on the role of an integrator—the one who helps teams navigate complexity with confidence and brings clarity through strong communication.
