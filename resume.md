## Professional Summary

System Architect and Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience helping companies deliver impactful digital products through automation, AI, and scalable architecture â€” across industries such as education, food safety, retail, and online sales. I build systems to make people's lives easier.

I started my career in front-end engineering, which shaped my product mindset and deep respect for the user experience. Later, I transitioned into fullstack and architectural roles, designing platforms end-to-end â€” from backend orchestration to polished UX using modern frameworks and clean design principles.

I've worked in both global and niche markets, delivering systems that served tens of thousands â€” and in some e-commerce cases, hundreds of thousands â€” of users in production. Most recently, I led AI-Driven development inside small, cross-functional squads focused on building secure, clean, human-integrated code alongside AI agents.

I naturally take on the role of an integrator â€” the one who explores, writes, diagrams, and helps the team navigate complexity with confidence. With a background in journalism, I bring clarity through communication, documentation, and a strong sense of direction that helps teams align and move forward together.
