## Professional Experience

### Staff AI Engineer (IC – Architecture Owner) | Clipboard Health

_Oct 2025 – Present · Remote (US)_

Architecture Owner for AI-driven document validation platform transforming manual SOP-based healthcare workflows. System processes ~1000 documents/day, achieving 70%+ automated approval rate with ~1% false-positive rate. Reshaped operational capacity by reducing manual dependency by 66%, enabling the organization to scale document throughput without linear headcount growth.

**Organizational & Architectural Impact**

- Defined long-term technical direction for AI validation workflows, aligning model performance thresholds with operational risk tolerance.
- Replaced manual review dependency with deterministic multi-LLM orchestration and rule-based fallback layers.
- Structured system for horizontal expansion across new document types without increasing operational headcount.
- Introduced evaluation gates and regression controls to ensure continuous deployment without degrading operational trust.

**Engineering Foundations**

- Established three-layer domain architecture with strict dependency isolation.
- Implemented idempotent event consumers and transactional background jobs for resilience at scale.
- Designed type-safe contracts ensuring cross-service integrity.

### Lead Software Developer | FoodReady

_Nov 2024 – Jul 2025 · Remote (US)_

Redefined backend execution model from time-based scheduling to event-driven architecture, enabling asynchronous scalability and reducing cross-team coordination overhead.

- Designed AWS-based event architecture (Lambda, EventBridge, SQS).
- Introduced AI-assisted automation agents integrated with workflow engines.
- Defined technical roadmap and architecture principles adopted by engineering team.

### Senior Software Developer | FoodReady

_Nov 2023 – Nov 2024 · Remote (US)_
